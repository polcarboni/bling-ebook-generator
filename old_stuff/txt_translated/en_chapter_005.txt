3. Mary's Child=+=..
In front of a large forest lived a woodcutter with his wife who had only one child, a girl of three years..
But they were so poor that they no longer had their daily bread and did not know what to give him to eat..
One morning the woodcutter went out into the forest to his work, full of worries, and as he was chopping wood, suddenly a tall, beautiful woman stood before him. She had a crown of shining stars on her head and said to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, the mother of the Christ Child..
you are poor and needy, bring me your child, I will take it with me, be its mother and care for it." The woodcutter obeyed, fetched his child and gave it to the Virgin Mary, who took it with her up to heaven..
Then he was happy; he ate sugar bread and drank sweet milk, and his clothes were made of gold, and the angels played with him..
When she was fourteen years old, the Virgin Mary called her to her and said, "Dear child, I have a long journey before me, so take the keys to the thirteen doors of the kingdom of heaven for safekeeping..
Twelve of them you may open and look at the splendours within, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden to you. Take care not to open it, or you will be unhappy." The girl promised to obey, and when the Virgin Mary had gone, she began to look at the mansions of the kingdom of heaven..
Every day it opened one until the twelve were around..
In each one sat an apostle, and was surrounded by great splendor, and he rejoiced at all the splendor and glory, and the angels who always accompanied him rejoiced with him..
Now the forbidden door was the only one left, and she felt a great desire to know what was hidden behind it, and said to the angels, "I will not open it quite, nor will I go in, but I will unlock it, that we may see a little through the crack." "Ah, no," said the angels, "that would be a sin;.
the Virgin Mary has forbidden it, and it could easily be your misfortune." Then he remained silent, but the desire in his heart did not remain silent, but gnawed and pecked at him and gave him no peace..
And when the angels had all gone out, she thought, "Now I am quite alone, and could look in; no one would know if I did." She looked for the key, and when she had it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it..
Then the door flew open, and there sat the Trinity, all fire and splendor..
It stood there for a while and looked at everything in amazement, then it touched the shine a little with its finger and the finger turned completely golden..
Immediately it felt a great fear, slammed the door and ran away..
The fear would not go away, no matter what it started, and the heart kept pounding and would not calm down;.
The gold also remained on the finger and did not come off, no matter how much it was washed and rubbed..

Not long after, the Virgin Mary returned from her journey..
She called the girl to her and asked her to give her the keys to heaven back..
When she handed over the bundle, the maiden looked her in the eyes and said: "Have you not opened the thirteenth door?" "No," she answered..
Then she laid her hand on his heart, felt how it beat and beat, and realized that he had disobeyed her command and opened the door..
Then she said again: "You surely did not do it?" "No," said the girl for the second time..
Then she saw the finger, which had turned golden from the touch of the heavenly fire, and saw clearly that it had sinned, and said for the third time: "Have you not done it?" "No," said the girl for the third time..
Then the Virgin Mary said: "You have not obeyed me, and you have also lied; you are no longer worthy to be in heaven."=+=..
Then the girl sank into a deep sleep, and when she awoke, she was lying on the ground, in the middle of a wilderness..
It wanted to call, but it could not make a sound..
It jumped up and wanted to run away, but wherever it turned, it was always held back by thick thorn bushes that it could not break through..
In the wilderness in which it was enclosed, there stood an old tall tree; that must have been its home..
When night came it crept in and slept there, and when it stormed and rained it found shelter there;.
But it was a miserable life, and when she thought of how beautiful it had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her, she wept bitterly..
Roots and wild berries were its only food, which it sought out wherever it could..
In the autumn it gathered the fallen nuts and leaves and carried them into the cave; the nuts were its food in the winter, and when snow and ice came, it crawled like a poor little creature into the leaves so that it would not freeze..
Before long, his clothes were torn and fell off his body, piece by piece..
As soon as the sun shone warmly again, it went out and sat down in front of the tree, and its long hair covered it on all sides like a cloak..
So it sat year after year and felt the misery and suffering of the world..

Once, when the trees were once again a fresh green, the king of the country was hunting in the forest and pursued a deer, and because it had fled into the bushes that enclosed the forest area, he dismounted, tore the undergrowth apart, and cut a path for himself with his sword..
When he finally got through, he saw a beautiful girl sitting under the tree, covered with her golden hair down to her toes..
He stood still and looked at it in amazement, then he spoke to it and said: "Who are you? Why are you sitting here in the wilderness?" But there was no answer, for it could not open its mouth..
The king continued: "Do you want to come with me to my castle?" Then the girl just nodded her head a little..
The king took her in his arms, carried her on his horse and rode home with her, and when he came to the royal palace he had her dressed in beautiful clothes and gave her everything in abundance..
And although she could not speak, she was so beautiful and lovely that he loved her with all his heart, and it was not long before he married her..

After about a year had passed, the queen gave birth to a son..
Then that night, as she lay alone in her bed, the Virgin Mary appeared to her and said: "If you will tell the truth and confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will open your mouth and give you your speech again;.
But if you persist in sin and stubbornly deny it, I will take your newborn child with me." Then the queen was given the opportunity to answer, but she remained stubborn and said: "No, I did not open the forbidden door," and the Virgin Mary took the newborn child from her arms and disappeared with it..
The next morning, when the child could not be found, there was a murmur among the people that the queen was a cannibal and had killed her own child..
She heard everything and could not say anything against it, but the king did not want to believe it because he loved her so much..

After a year the queen gave birth to another son..
During the night the Virgin Mary came to her again and said: "If you will confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your child and loose your tongue;.
But if you persist in sin and deny, I will take this newborn child with me too." Then the queen said again: "No, I did not open the forbidden door," and the virgin took the child from her arms and with her into heaven..
In the morning, when the child had disappeared again, the people said loudly that the queen had devoured it, and the king's counselors demanded that she should be judged..
But the king loved her so much that he did not want to believe it, and ordered the councilors not to speak of it any more under penalty of death..

The following year the queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter, and the Virgin Mary appeared to her for the third time at night and said, "Follow me." She took her by the hand and led her to heaven, and there showed her her two eldest children, who laughed at her and played with the globe..
When the queen was happy about this, the Virgin Mary said: "Has your heart not yet softened? If you admit that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your two little sons." But the queen answered for the third time: "No, I did not open the forbidden door." Then she let the virgin sink down to the ground again and took the third child from her as well..

The next morning, when the news got out, everyone cried out: "The queen is a cannibal, she must be condemned," and the king could no longer refuse his advisers..
She was tried and because she could not answer or defend herself, she was sentenced to die at the stake..
The wood was gathered together, and when she was tied to a stake and the fire began to burn all around her, the hard ice of pride melted and her heart was moved with remorse, and she thought: "If only I could confess before my death that I opened the door," then the voice came to her and she cried out aloud: "Yes, Mary, I did it!" And immediately the sky began to rain and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke out above her, and the Virgin Mary came down with the two little sons at her side and the new-born daughter in her arms..
She spoke kindly to her: "Whoever repents and admits his sin will be forgiven," and gave her the three children, loosened her tongue, and gave her happiness for the rest of her life..
