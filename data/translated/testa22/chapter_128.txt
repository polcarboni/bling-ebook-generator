126. Ferenand tempted and Ferenand untempted
Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had no children until they were young, but when they became very poor, they had a little boy.
But they couldn't get a paw at that time, so the man said he wanted to go to the other places and see if he could get one there.
As he was walking, he met a poor man who asked where he wanted to go. He said he wanted to go and see if he could get a pauper, he said, poor man, and there he didn't want to leave Minsk behind.
»O,« said the poor man, »you are poor and I am poor, I will be your good companion;
But I am so poor, I can't give the child anything, so she went and said the midwife that she should come to the prison with the children. When she came to the head of the prison, there was a beggar there, and she gave the child the name Ferenand.
As he was leaving the prison, the beggar said: "Now we're going home. I can't give you anything and I won't give you anything either." The peasant, however, gave him a hatch and said that when they got home they could give it to their father, who should keep it until the child was five years old, then they should go to the heath, there was a hatch, and the hatch fit into it, and they should hear what was in it.
When the child was now twenty years old and had grown up, he went to play with other boys, and one of them got even more from his father than the other, but he couldn't say anything, and he grinned and went home and said to his father: "So I didn't get anything from my father?" "Oh yes," said his father, "you got a chill; when there's a chimney on the heath, you go and shovel it up." So he went, but there was no chimney to hear or see.
After seven years, when he was five years old, he went there again and there was a chimney on it.
When he opened it up, he was nothing but a horse, a rascal.
Then the boy became so full of joy that he saw the horse and ran after it and chased his father.
"Now I have a brother, now I want to travel," he said.
So he sets off, and as he is on his way, there is a sign lying on the road. He wants to pick it up straight away, but then he thinks to himself: "Oh, you should leave it lying there too, you'll surely find a sign wherever you go if you cross one." As he sets off, someone shouts behind him: "Ferenand get drunk, take it with you." He sets off, but there is no one, so he goes back and picks it up.
As he rode like a wild horse, he came past the water and there lay a fish on the bank, snapping and gasping for air.
then he says: "Töv, my living fish, I will help you get into the water," and he grabs a swan and throws it into the water.
Then the fish sticks his head into the water and says: "Now that you've got me out of the mud, I'll give you a whistle;
If you're in the sea, blow your whistle and I'll help you, and if you've let something fall into the water, blow your whistle and I'll get it out." Now he was riding away and a man like Minsk came along and asked him where he wanted to go.
»Oh, to the nearest ear.« What does it mean then? »Ferenand drunk« »Sü, there we have as almost the same name, I call Ferenand drunk« Then they both stretch to the nearest ear into the Wertshus.
Now it was bad that Ferenand knew without doubt everything that another had thought and wanted to do;
he knew there were all kinds of clever arts.
There was a brave girl in the shop, she had a clear face and dressed so pretty;
that's what happens in the far country, because there's a pretty guy there and he asks where he wants to go.
"Oh, if he wanted to travel farther," they said, he should just stay here; there would be a king here in Lann, and no one would be more of a servant or forerunner.
there he should go into service.
He said, he couldn't go to someone like that and watch it.
Then the girl said, “Oh, I’ll believe that then.” And so she went straight to the king and saw that he was a handsome servant.
That was probably what they were hoping for and they would come and do something to the affected person.
He wanted to be a loyal forerunner, because where his horses were, there they must be too: then the king made him the forerunner.
When the Ferenand became aware of this, he said to the maiden, "Töv, will you help him and my little one?" "Oh," said the maiden, "I will help him too." She thought, "You must protect him from the enemies, for there is nothing to be done about him." She then went to stand before the king and addressed him as his servants.
that is the king's day.
When he greeted the gentlemen in the morning, the young man moaned: “Oh, if only I had my dearest with me!” The stranger was upset, but the older man cheered the younger man up.
As the king was once complaining again, he said: "You have the outrider, send him there, he must bring them here, and if he doesn't, his head must be laid at his feet." Then the king ordered the soldier to come and see that he had a weakling here and there, and he would bring her here, if he didn't do that, he would die.
Ferdinand went drunk into the stable to his little man and grinned and moaned: "Oh, what an unfortunate child I am!" Then someone shouted behind him: "The faithful Ferdinand, why are you crying?" He looked around, but looked at nothing, and moaned more and more: "O my dear little man, now I must leave him, now I must die." Then he shouted again: "The faithful Ferdinand, why are you crying?" Then he realized that this was his little man who was asking.
"Are you asleep, my little rascal, can you speak?" And he said, "I shall go here and there and hold the brood, if you don't know how I shall begin." Then the rascal answered, "Go to the king and tell him, if he wanted to give him what you wanted, then you would have to grab him;
If he wanted to give them a bucket full of meat and a bucket full of bread, it would work;
There were terrible giants on the water, and if you didn't bring them any meat, they would kill you.
and there were the grey birds that would peck your eyes out from your head if you had no bread before them.” Then the king had all the butchers in the country slaughter and all the bakers bake until the shovel was full.
When they were full, the little rascal said to Ferenand: »Now go up to my seats and take me into the ship, when the giants come, they say:
âºHush, hush, my dear giants,
I have thought of you well,
I brought you something.
â¹
And when the bird comes, you say again:
âºHush, hush, my dear little birds,
I have thought of you well,
I brought you something.
â¹
Then she doesn't do anything, and when you get to the castle, she helps the giants, then go up to the castle and take a couple of giants with you, there lies the princess and screams;
But you must not wake her up, otherwise the giants will have to pick her up with the beds and throw her into the boat." And then everything happened as the little white horse had said, and Ferenand gave the giants and the birds what he had brought them, and in return the giants agreed and carried the princess in her bed to the king.
And when she came to the king, she said that she could not live, she had to take his writings, which would remain lying on his castle.
Then the Ferenand will be brought to justice by those who have instigated the Ferenand, and the king will order him to keep the writings from the castle, lest he die.
Then he goes back into the stable and grins and says: "Oh, my little rascals, now I have to go again, how are we going to do that?" Then the rascals say they have to load the ship full again.
Then it happens again as before, and the giants and the birds are satisfied and appeased by the meat.
When she came to the castle, the scoundrel said that he should go in, into the princess's bedroom, where the papers were lying on the table.
Then Ferenand comes rushing here and takes her.
When they're up on the water and he lets his penguins fall into the water, the rascal says, "Now I can't help you at all." Then it falls with the flute squeaking, he starts to whistle, then the fish comes and the penny is in his mouth and he grabs them.
Now he brings the writings to the chimney, where the high tide will resound.
The queen wanted to leave the king because he had no nose, or she wanted to let the prince be deceived.
Now that all the gentlemen from the house are together, the queen says she can do tricks, she can knock your head off and upset you, only one of them has to miss it.
But no one wanted to be the only one, and Ferenand had to confess to it, as if at Ferenand's instigation, they lifted their heads up and sat back up again, and luckily it healed like a dew, which turned out to be because they had a red thread around their necks.
Then the king asked, “My child, where did you learn that?” “Yes,” she said, “I understand the art. Shall I try it on you?” “Oh yes,” he said.
Then she puts her head upside down and sits back down, as if she can't get anything out of it and as if she doesn't want to sit tight.
There the king will be buried, but the Ferenand will be punished.
He was riding his horse but still, and when he got to him, he said, he was supposed to take him to another heath that he knew and chase him around there three times.
As soon as he had done that, the rascal stood on his hind legs and turned into a king's son.
