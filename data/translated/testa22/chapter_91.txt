89. The Goose Girl
Once upon a time there lived an old queen whose husband had died many years ago and they had a beautiful daughter.
When she grew up, she was promised to a king's son far across the field.
When the time came for them to be married and for the child to leave for a foreign kingdom, the old woman packed up a lot of precious utensils and jewelry for her, gold and silver, goblets and jewels, in short, everything that belonged to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.
She also gave her a chambermaid who was to ride with her and deliver the bride into the hands of the groom, and each of them was given a horse for the journey, but the horse of the king's daughters was called Falada and could speak.
When the hour of departure had come, the old mother went into her bedroom, took a little knife and cut her fingers until they bled;
Then she held a white cloth underneath and let three drops of blood fall into it, gave them to her daughter and said: "Dear child, keep them well, you will need them on the way."
So they both said goodbye to each other with sadness;
The princess put the little cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse and went away to her bridegroom.
After they had ridden for an hour, she felt very thirsty and said to her chambermaid, "Dismount and draw me some water from the stream with the cup that you have brought for me; I would like to drink some." "If you are thirsty," said the chambermaid, "then dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink; I do not want to be your maid." Then the princess, because she was so thirsty, got down, bent over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink from the golden cup.
Then she said: "Ah, God!" and the three drops of blood answered: "If your mother knew that, her heart would burst within her." But the king's bride was humble, said nothing, and got back on her horse.
So they rode on for several miles;
But the day was warm, the sun was burning, and she soon became thirsty again.
When they came to a stream, she called once more to her chambermaid: "Dismount and give me a drink from my golden cup," for she had long since forgotten all the bad words.
But the chambermaid spoke even more arrogantly: "If you want to drink, drink alone; I will not be your maid." Then the princess climbed down because she was so thirsty, lay down over the flowing water, wept and said: "Oh God!" and the drops of blood answered again: "If your mother knew that, her heart would burst." And as she drank thus and leaned over, the little cloth in which the three drops were fell from her bosom and flowed away with the water without her noticing it in her great fear.
But the chambermaid had been watching and was happy that she would gain power over the bride;
For by losing the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless.
When she wanted to get back on her horse, which was called Falada, the chambermaid said: "I belong to Falada, and you belong to my horse;
« and she had to put up with that.
Then the chambermaid harshly ordered her to take off her royal clothes and put on her poor ones, and finally she had to swear in the open air that she would not say anything about it to anyone at the royal court;
and if she had not taken this oath, she would have been killed on the spot.
But Falada saw all this and took it into consideration.
The chambermaid then mounted Falada and the true bride mounted the poor horse, and so they continued on until they finally arrived at the royal palace.
There was great joy at their arrival, and the prince ran to meet them, lifted the chambermaid from her horse, and thought she was his wife;
She was led up the stairs, but the real princess had to remain below.
Then the old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard and saw how fine, delicate and very beautiful she was;
went straight into the royal chamber and asked the bride about the woman who was with her and who was standing down there in the courtyard, and who she was? "I took her along with me on the way as a companion;
give the maid something to work with so that she does not stand idle." But the old king had no work for her and knew nothing except to say, "I have a little boy who looks after the geese; she can help him." The boy's name was Kürdchen (Konrädchen), and the true bride had to help him look after the geese.
Soon, however, the false bride said to the young king: "Dearest husband, I beg you, do me a favor." He answered: "I will gladly do that." "Well then, call the flayer and cut off the neck of the horse on which I rode here, because it annoyed me on the way." But really she was afraid that the horse might tell her how she had treated the king's daughter.
Now things had gotten so bad that it was about to happen and the faithful Falada was going to die, and the king's daughter heard about it, and she secretly promised the flayer a piece of money that she would pay him if he did her a small favor.
In the city there was a large, dark gate through which she had to go with the geese in the evenings and mornings;
He would like to nail Falada's head beneath the dark gate so that she could see him more than once.
So the slave driver promised to do so, cut off the head, and nailed it beneath the dark gate.
Early in the morning, as she and Kürdchen were driving out of the gate, she said as she passed by:
»O you Falada, who hang,«
then the head answered:
»O thou maiden queen, as thou wentest,
If your mother knew,
her heart would burst"
Then they quietly continued out of the city and drove the geese into the fields.
And when she arrived in the meadow, she sat down and let down her hair, which was pure gold, and Curt saw it and was happy at how it shone, and wanted to tear out some of it.
Then she said:
»Ah, ah, little wind,
take Kürdchen’s hat,
and let yourself be hunted,
until I braided and snatched
and reassembled«
And then a wind came that was so strong that it blew little Kurt's hat away across the land, and he had to run after it.
By the time it came back, she had finished combing it and putting it up, and he couldn't get any hair.
Then Kürdchen was angry and did not speak to her;
And so they looked after the geese until evening, then they went home.
The next morning, as they were driving out of the dark gate, the maiden said:
»O you Falada, there you hang,«
Falada replied:
»O you virgin queen;
as you went,
If your mother knew,
her heart would burst"
And in the field she sat down again on the meadow and began to comb her hair, and Curt ran and wanted to grab it, when she said quickly:
»Ah, ah, little wind,
take Kürdchen’s hat,
and let yourself be hunted,
until I braided and snatched
and reassembled«
Then the wind blew and blew the hat from his head so far away that Kürdchen had to run after it;
and when it came again, she had already arranged her hair, and it could not catch any of it;
and so they looked after the geese until evening.
But in the evening, after they had come home, Kurtchen went to the old king and said: "I don't want to herd geese with that girl any longer." "Why?" asked the old king.
"Well, that annoys me all day long." Then the old king ordered him to tell him how things were going with her.
Then Kürdchen said: »In the morning, when we pass through the dark gate with the herd, there is a horse's head on the wall, to which she speaks:
âºFalada, there you hang,â¹
the head answers:
âºO you royal maiden, as you went,
If your mother knew,
her heart would burst.
â¹«
And so Kürdchen continued to tell what was happening on the goose meadow and how it had to run after the hat in the wind.
The old king ordered him to drive her out again the next day, and he himself, when it was morning, sat down behind the dark gate and heard her talking to the head of Falada, and then he followed her into the field and hid himself in a bush in the meadow.
Then he soon saw with his own eyes how the goose girl and the goose boy drove the flock, and how after a while she sat down and unbraided her hair, which shone with splendor.
She immediately spoke again:
»Ah, ah, little wind, grab hold of Kürdchen’s hat,
and let yourself be hunted,
until I braided and snatched
and reassembled«
Then a gust of wind came and blew away Kurtchen's hat so that she had to run a long way, and the maid continued combing and braiding her locks in silence, all of which the old king observed.
Then he went back unnoticed, and when the goose girl came home in the evening, he called her aside and asked her why she was doing all this? "I must not tell you that, and I must not tell anyone of my suffering, for I have sworn in the open air, otherwise I would have lost my life." He pressed her and gave her no peace, but he could not get anything out of her.
Then he said, "If you will not tell me, then tell your sorrow to the iron stove over there," and went away.
Then she crept into the iron stove, began to lament and weep, poured out her heart and said: "Here I sit, abandoned by all the world, and yet I am a king's daughter, and a false chambermaid has forced me to lay aside my royal robes, and has taken my place with my bridegroom, and I must do menial work as a goose-girl.
If my mother knew that, her heart would burst within her." But the old king stood outside the stove pipe, watching her and listening to what she said.
Then he came in again and told them to come out of the oven.
Then she was dressed in royal clothes, and it seemed a miracle how beautiful she was.
The old king called his son and revealed to him that he had the wrong bride: she was only a chambermaid, but the real one stood here as the former goose girl.
The young king was gladdened when he saw her beauty and virtue, and a great feast was prepared to which all the people and good friends were invited.
The bridegroom sat at the top, the king's daughter on one side and the chambermaid on the other, but the chambermaid was blinded and no longer recognized her in her shining jewelry.
When they had eaten and drunk and were in good spirits, the old king posed a riddle to the chambermaid as to what a woman who had deceived such and such a lord would be worth, and she related the whole story and asked: "What sentence is she worthy of?" Then the false bride said: "She deserves nothing better than to be stripped stark naked and put into a barrel that is studded with sharp nails on the inside, and two white horses must be harnessed to her and drag her down street after street to her death." "That is you," said the old king, "and you have found your own sentence, and that is what shall happen to you." And when the sentence was carried out, the young king married his true wife, and both ruled their kingdom in peace and bliss.
