194. The Ear of Corn
In earlier times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fertility of the soil was much greater than it is now: then the ears of corn bore not fifty or sixty times as much, but four to five hundred times as much.
Then the grains grew up the stalk from bottom to top;
As long as he was, so long was the ear of corn.
But as people are, in their abundance they no longer respect the blessing that comes from God, they become indifferent and careless.
One day a woman was walking past a cornfield, and her little child, jumping beside her, fell into a puddle and soiled his dress.
Then the mother tore off a handful of the beautiful ears of corn and cleaned his dress with them.
When the master, who was passing by, saw this, he was angry and said, â€œFrom now on the stalk of corn shall not bear an ear;
Men are no longer worthy of the heavenly gift.' Those standing around who heard this were frightened, fell on their knees and begged him to leave some of the stalk standing;
Even if they themselves did not deserve it, they did so for the sake of the innocent chickens who would otherwise starve.
The Lord, foreseeing their misery, took pity on them and granted their request.
So the ear of corn remained at the top as it is growing now.
